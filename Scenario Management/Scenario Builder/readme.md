In this example:

A new Scenario model is defined using SQLAlchemy, which will map to a table in the SQLite database scenarios.db.
Three routes are defined using Flask:
A POST route to /scenarios for creating new scenarios.
A GET route to /scenarios for listing all scenarios.
A GET route to /scenarios/<int:scenario_id> for retrieving a specific scenario by its ID.
On startup, db.create_all() is called to create the necessary tables, and app.run() is called to start the Flask application.
